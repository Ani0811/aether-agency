## ⚡ Database Setup Order

Paste and run the `.sql` scripts directly in the **Supabase SQL Editor** in the following sequence:

1. **`core/schema.sql`** — Initializes the foundation tables, UUID structures, and base permissions.
2. **`core/seed_portfolio.sql`** — Loads the project records.
3. **`core/seed_case_studies.sql`** — Loads the rich metadata and metrics for the slug routes.
4. **`reviews/reviews_setup.sql`** — Sets up the client reviews table and lists the bucket policies for profile image storage uploads.
5. **`chat/chat_agent_setup.sql`** — Deploys the logging tables for contacts, leads, and refunds initiated by the AI chat agent.
6. **`rag/rag_setup.sql`** — Activates `pgvector` and structures the semantic context mapping store.

## 🧪 Admin & Query Inspection

For ongoing troubleshooting and analytics (such as counting rows, identifying tables, inspecting columns, or checking database sizes), run the scripts inside **`explore/explore_queries.sql`**.
